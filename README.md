# Graph Signal Processing

In this repository, Some fascinating features of Graph Signal Processing were represented. Demos incudes applying a low-pass filter on both 1D and 2D euclidian domain signal by classical signal processing and also Graph signal processing to compare both results are the same. Within that way, we will validate the working mechanism of Graph Signal Processing. In addition to this, an example of filtering a signal on the non-euclidian domain was also represented.
